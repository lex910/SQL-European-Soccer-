This project explores the European Soccer database using SQL and tableau to provide insights into trends. 

Data Overview:
The data is sourced from Kaggle. There are 7 different data files. The files include country, league, match, player, playyer_attributes, team, and team_attributes. Country and league share id as a primary key to show the relationship of which leagues belong to which European country. League and match share country_id as a primary key. Player and player_attribute are linked by player_api_id, while team and team_attributes have team_api_id as primary keys. Overall the data shows the different leagues in several European countries, specific match details, player demographics, player specific match statistics, teams, and individual team attributes.
